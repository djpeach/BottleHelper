Helping template for bottle with python for CS 230.

This template is a guide I put together to help myself with creating Bottle apps with Python.  I figured it might be able to help some of my classmates as well, so I put it on my github. Hopefully this helps some people. Feel free to improve it and update it as needed.

For additional information on Bottle, you can also check out the Bottle Docs themselves.
